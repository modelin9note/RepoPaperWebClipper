Medical Statistics at a Glance is directed at undergraduate
medical students, medical researchers, postgraduates in the
biomedical disciplines and at pharmaceutical industry personnel.
All of these individuals will, at some time in their professional
lives, be faced with quantitative results (their own or those
of others) which will need to be critically evaluated and interpreted,
and some, of course, will have to pass that dreaded statistics
exam! A proper understanding of statistical concepts and
methodology is invaluable for these needs. Much as we should
like to fire the reader with an enthusiasm for the subject of statistics,
we are pragmatic. Our aim in this new edition, as it was in
the earlier editions, is to provide the student and the researcher,
as well as the clinician encountering statistical concepts in the
medical literature, with a book which is sound, easy to read,
comprehensive, relevant, and of useful practical application.

We believe Medical Statistics at a Glance will be particularly
helpful as an adjunct to statistics lectures and as a reference
guide. The structure of this fourth edition is the same as that
of the first three editions. In line with other books in the At a
Glance series, we lead the reader through a number of selfcontained
two-, three- or occasionally four-page chapters, each
covering a different aspect of medical statistics. There is extensive
cross-referencing throughout the text to help the reader link the
various procedures. We have learned from our own teaching
experiences and have taken account of the difficulties that our
students have encountered when studying medical statistics. For
this reason, we have chosen to limit the theoretical content of the
book to a level that is sufficient for understanding the procedures
involved, yet which does not overshadow the practicalities of
their execution.

Medical statistics is a wide-ranging subject covering a large
number of topics. We have provided a basic introduction to the
underlying concepts of medical statistics and a guide to the most
commonly used statistical procedures. Epidemiology, concerned
with the distribution and determinants of disease in specified
populations, is closely allied to medical statistics. Hence some
of the main issues in epidemiology, relating to study design and
interpretation, are discussed. Also included are chapters that
the reader may find useful only occasionally, but which are,
nevertheless, fundamental to many areas of medical research;
for example, evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews
and meta-analysis, survival analysis, Bayesian methods and
the development of prognostic scores. We have explained the
principles underlying these topics so that the reader will be able
to understand and interpret the results from them when they are
presented in the literature.

A basic set of statistical tables is contained in Appendix A.
Neave, H.R. (1995) Elementary Statistical Tables, Routledge:
London, and Diem, K. Lenter, C. and Seldrup (1981) Geigy
Scientific Tables, 8th rev. and enl. edition, Basle: Ciba-Geigy,
amongst others, provide fuller versions if the reader requires
more precise results for hand calculations. We have included
a new appendix, Appendix D, in this fourth edition. This
appendix contains guidelines for randomized controlled trials
(the CONSORT checklist and flow chart) and observational
studies (the STROBE checklist). The CONSORT and STROBE
checklists are produced by the EQUATOR Network, initiated
with the objectives of providing resources and training for the
reporting of health research. Guidelines for the presentation of
study results are now available for many other types of study
and we provide website addresses in a table in Appendix D for
some of these designs. Appendix D also contains templates
that we hope you will find useful when you critically appraise
or evaluate the evidence in randomized controlled trials and
observational studies. The use of these templates to critically
appraise two published papers is demonstrated in our Medical
Statistics at a Glance Workbook. Due to the inclusion of the new
Appendix D, the labeling of the final two appendices differs from
that of the third edition: Appendix E now contains the Glossary
of terms with readily accessible explanations of commonly used
terminology, and Appendix F provides cross-referencing of
multiple choice and structured questions from Medical Statistics
at a Glance Workbook.

The chapter titles of this fourth edition are identical to
those of the third edition. Some of the first 46 chapters remain
unaltered in this new edition and some have relatively minor
changes which accommodate recent advances, cross-referencing
or re-organization of the new material. In particular, where
appropriate, we have provided references to the relevant
EQUATOR guidelines.
As in the third edition, we provide a set of learning objectives
for each chapter. Each set provides a framework for evaluating
understanding and progress. If you are able to complete all the
bulleted tasks in a chapter satisfactorily, you will have mastered
the concepts in that chapter.

Most of the statistical techniques described in the book
are accompanied by examples illustrating their use. We have
replaced many of the older examples that were in previous
editions by those that are commensurate with current clinical
research. We have generally obtained the data for our examples
from collaborative studies in which we or colleagues have
been involved; in some instances, we have used real data from
published papers. Where possible, we have used the same data
set in more than one chapter to reflect the reality of data analysis,
which is rarely restricted to a single technique or approach.

Although we believe that formulae should be provided and the
logic of the approach explained as an aid to understanding, we
have avoided showing the details of complex calculations – most
readers will have access to computers and are unlikely to perform
any but the simplest calculations by hand.
We consider that it is particularly important for the reader to
be able to interpret output from a computer package. We have
therefore chosen, where applicable, to show results using extracts
from computer output. In some instances, where we believe
individuals may have difficulty with its interpretation, we have
included (Appendix C) and annotated the complete computer
output from an analysis of a data set. There are many statistical
packages in common use; to give the reader an indication of how
output can vary, we have not restricted the output to a particular
package and have, instead, used four well-known ones – SAS,
SPSS, Stata and R.

We know that one of the greatest difficulties facing nonstatisticians
is choosing the appropriate technique. We have
therefore produced two flow charts which can be used both to
aid the decision as to what method to use in a given situation and
to locate a particular technique in the book easily. These flow
charts are displayed prominently on the inside back cover for
easy access.

Data and statistics
The purpose of most studies is to collect data to obtain information
about a particular area of research. Our data comprise observations
on one or more variables; any quantity that varies is termed
a variable. For example, we may collect basic clinical and demographic
information on patients with a particular illness. The variables
of interest may include the sex, age and height of the patients.
Our data are usually obtained from a sample of individuals
that represents the population of interest. Our aim is to condense
these data in a meaningful way and extract useful information
from them. Statistics encompasses the methods of collecting,
summarizing, analysing and drawing conclusions from the data:
we use statistical techniques to achieve our aim.
Data may take many different forms. We need to know what
form every variable takes before we can make a decision regarding
the most appropriate statistical methods to use. Each variable
and the resulting data will be one of two types: categorical or
numerical (Fig. 1.1).

Nominal Ordinal Discrete Continuous
Categories
are mutually
exclusive and
unordered
e.g.
Sex (male/
female)
Blood group
(A/B/AB/O)
Categories
are mutually
exclusive and
ordered
e.g.
Disease stage
(mild/moderate/
severe)
Integer values,
typically
counts
e.g.
Days sick
last year
Takes any value
in a range of
values
e.g.
Weight in kg
Height in cm

Categorical (qualitative) data
These occur when each individual can only belong to one of a
number of distinct categories of the variable.
• Nominal data – the categories are not ordered but simply have
names. Examples include blood group (A, B, AB and O) and
marital status (married/widowed/single, etc.). In this case, there
is no reason to suspect that being married is any better (or worse)
than being single!
• Ordinal data – the categories are ordered in some way. Examples
include disease staging systems (advanced, moderate, mild,
none) and degree of pain (severe, moderate, mild, none).
A categorical variable is binary or dichotomous when there
are only two possible categories. Examples include ‘Yes/No’, ‘Dead/
Alive’ or ‘Patient has disease/Patient does not have disease’.

Numerical (quantitative) data
These occur when the variable takes some numerical value. We
can subdivide numerical data into two types.
• Discrete data – occur when the variable can only take certain
whole numerical values. These are often counts of numbers of
events, such as the number of visits to a GP in a particular year or the
number of episodes of illness in an individual over the last 5 years.
• Continuous data – occur when there is no limitation on the
values that the variable can take, e.g. weight or height, other than
that which restricts us when we make the measurement.

Distinguishing between data types
We often use very different statistical methods depending on
whether the data are categorical or numerical. Although the
distinction between categorical and numerical data is usually
clear, in some situations it may become blurred. For example,
when we have a variable with a large number of ordered categories
(e.g. a pain scale with seven categories), it may be difficult
to distinguish it from a discrete numerical variable. The
distinction between discrete and continuous numerical data
may be even less clear, although in general this will have little
impact on the results of most analyses. Age is an example of a
variable that is often treated as discrete even though it is truly
continuous. We usually refer to ‘age at last birthday’ rather than
‘age’, and therefore, a woman who reports being 30 may have
just had her 30th birthday, or may be just about to have her
31st birthday.
Do not be tempted to record numerical data as categorical at
the outset (e.g. by recording only the range within which each
patient’s age falls rather than his/her actual age) as important
information is often lost. It is simple to convert numerical data to
categorical data once they have been collected.

Derived data
We may encounter a number of other types of data in the medical
field. These include:
• Percentages – these may arise when considering improvements
in patients following treatment, e.g. a patient’s lung

function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1) may 3
increase by 24% following treatment with a new drug. In this
case, it is the level of improvement, rather than the absolute
value, which is of interest.
• Ratios or quotients – occasionally you may encounter the
ratio or quotient of two variables. For example, body mass index
(BMI), calculated as an individual’s weight (kg) divided by her/
his height squared (m2), is often used to assess whether s/he is
over- or underweight.
• Rates – disease rates, in which the number of disease events
occurring among individuals in a study is divided by the total
number of years of follow-up of all individuals in that study
(Chapter 31), are common in epidemiological studies (Chapter 12).
• Scores – we sometimes use an arbitrary value, such as a score,
when we cannot measure a quantity. For example, a series of
responses to questions on quality of life may be summed to give
some overall quality of life score on each individual.
All these variables can be treated as numerical variables for most
analyses. Where the variable is derived using more than one value
(e.g. the numerator and denominator of a percentage), it is important
to record all of the values used. For example, a 10% improvement in
a marker following treatment may have different clinical relevance
depending on the level of the marker before treatment.

Censored data
We may come across censored data in situations illustrated by
the following examples.
• If we measure laboratory values using a tool that can only detect
levels above a certain cut-off value, then any values below this cutoff
will not be detected, i.e. they are censored. For example, when
measuring virus levels, those below the limit of detectability will
often be reported as ‘undetectable’ or ‘unquantifiable’ even though
there may be some virus in the sample. In this situation, if the lower
cut-off of a tool is x, say, the results may be reported as ‘ < x’. Similarly,
some tools may only be able to reliably quantify levels below a
certain cut-off value, say y; any measurements above that value will
also be censored and the test result may be reported as ‘ > y’.
• We may encounter censored data when following patients in
a trial in which, for example, some patients withdraw from the
trial before the trial has ended. This type of data is discussed in
more detail in Chapter 44.

• Describe different formats for entering data on to a computer

• Distinguish between single-coded and multi-coded variables
• Describe how to code missing values

When you carry out any study you will almost always need to
enter the data into a computer package. Computers are invaluable
for improving the accuracy and speed of data collection and
analysis, making it easy to check for errors, produce graphical
summaries of the data and generate new variables. It is worth
spending some time planning data entry – this may save considerable
effort at later stages.

Formats for data entry
There are a number of ways in which data can be entered and
stored on a computer. Most statistical packages allow you to
enter data directly. However, the limitation of this approach is
that often you cannot move the data to another package. A simple
alternative is to store the data in either a spreadsheet or database
package. Unfortunately, their statistical procedures are often
limited, and it will usually be necessary to output the data into a
specialist statistical package to carry out analyses.
A more flexible approach is to have your data available as an
ASCII or text file. Once in an ASCII format, the data can be read
by most packages. ASCII format simply consists of rows of text
that you can view on a computer screen. Usually, each variable
in the file is separated from the next by some delimiter, often a
space or a comma. This is known as free format.
The simplest way of entering data in ASCII format is to type
the data directly in this format using either a word processing
or editing package. Alternatively, data stored in spreadsheet
packages can be saved in ASCII format. Using either approach,
it is customary for each row of data to correspond to a different
individual in the study, and each column to correspond to a
different variable, although it may be necessary to go on to
subsequent rows if data from a large number of variables are
collected on each individual.

different variable, although it may be necessary to go on to
subsequent rows if data from a large number of variables are
collected on each individual.

Planning data entry
When collecting data in a study you will often need to use a form
or questionnaire for recording the data. If these forms are designed
carefully, they can reduce the amount of work that has to be done
when entering the data. Generally, these forms/questionnaires
include a series of boxes in which the data are recorded – it is usual
to have a separate box for each possible digit of the response.

Categorical data
Some statistical packages have problems dealing with nonnumerical
data. Therefore, you may need to assign numerical
codes to categorical data before entering the data into the computer.
For example, you may choose to assign the codes of 1, 2,
3 and 4 to categories of ‘no pain’, ‘mild pain’, ‘moderate pain’ and
‘severe pain’, respectively. These codes can be added to the forms
when collecting the data. For binary data, e.g. yes/no answers,
it is often convenient to assign the codes 1 (e.g. for ‘yes’) and 0
(for ‘no’).
• Single-coded variables – there is only one possible answer to
a question, e.g. ‘Is the patient dead?’ It is not possible to answer
both ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to this question.
• Multi-coded variables – more than one answer is possible for
each respondent. For example, ‘What symptoms has this patient
experienced?’ In this case, an individual may have experienced
any of a number of symptoms. There are two ways to deal with
this type of data depending upon which of the two following
situations applies.
■■There are only a few possible symptoms, and individuals
may have experienced many of them. A number of different
binary variables can be created that correspond to whether the
patient has answered yes or no to the presence of each possible
symptom. For example, ‘Did the patient have a cough?’, ‘Did
the patient have a sore throat?’
■■ There are a very large number of possible symptoms
but each patient is expected to suffer from only a few of
them. A number of different nominal variables can be created;
each successive variable allows you to name a symptom
suffered by the patient. For example, ‘What was the
first symptom the patient suffered?’, ‘What was the second
symptom?’ You will need to decide in advance the maximum
number of symptoms you think a patient is likely to
have suffered.

Categorical data
Some statistical packages have problems dealing with nonnumerical
data. Therefore, you may need to assign numerical
codes to categorical data before entering the data into the computer.
For example, you may choose to assign the codes of 1, 2,
3 and 4 to categories of ‘no pain’, ‘mild pain’, ‘moderate pain’ and
‘severe pain’, respectively. These codes can be added to the forms
when collecting the data. For binary data, e.g. yes/no answers,
it is often convenient to assign the codes 1 (e.g. for ‘yes’) and 0
(for ‘no’).
• Single-coded variables – there is only one possible answer to
a question, e.g. ‘Is the patient dead?’ It is not possible to answer
both ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to this question.
• Multi-coded variables – more than one answer is possible for
each respondent. For example, ‘What symptoms has this patient
experienced?’ In this case, an individual may have experienced
any of a number of symptoms. There are two ways to deal with

symptom. For example, ‘Did the patient have a cough?’, ‘Did
the patient have a sore throat?’

but each patient is expected to suffer from only a few of

suffered by the patient. For example, ‘What was the
first symptom the patient suffered?’, ‘What was the second
symptom?’ You will need to decide in advance the maximum
number of symptoms you think a patient is likely to
have suffered.

Numerical data
Numerical data should be entered with the same precision as
they are measured, and the unit of measurement should be consistent
for all observations on a variable. For example, weight
should be recorded in kilograms or in pounds, but not both
interchangeably.

Multiple forms per patient
Sometimes, information is collected on the same patient on
more than one occasion. It is important that there is some
unique identifier (e.g. a serial number) relating to the individual
that will enable you to link all of the data from an individual in
the study.

Dates and times should be entered in a consistent manner, e.g. either
as day/month/year or month/day/year, but not interchangeably. It is
important to find out what format the statistical package can read.

Coding missing values
You should consider what you will do with missing values before
you enter the data. In most cases you will need to use some symbol
to represent a missing value. Statistical packages deal with 
missing values in different ways. Some use special characters
(e.g. a full stop or asterisk) to indicate missing values, whereas
others require you to define your own code for a missing value
(commonly used values are 9, 999 or − 99). The value that is chosen
should be one that is not possible for that variable. For example,
when entering a categorical variable with four categories
(coded 1, 2, 3 and 4), you may choose the value 9 to represent
missing values. However, if the variable is ‘age of child’ then a
different code should be chosen. Missing data are discussed in
more detail in Chapter 3.

As part of a study on the effect of inherited bleeding disorders
on pregnancy and childbirth, data were collected on a sample of
64 women registered at a single haemophilia centre in London.
The women were asked questions relating to their bleeding
disorder and their first pregnancy (or their current pregnancy
if they were pregnant for the first time on the date of interview).
Figure 2.1 shows the data from a small selection of the women
after the data have been entered onto a spreadsheet, but
before they have been checked for errors. The coding schemes
for the categorical variables are shown at the bottom of Fig. 2.1.
Each row of the spreadsheet represents a separate individual
in the study; each column represents a different variable. Where
the woman is still pregnant, the age of the woman at the time of
birth has been calculated from the estimated date of the baby’s
delivery. Data relating to the live births are summarized in
Table 37.1 in Chapter 37.

In any study there is always the potential for errors to occur in a
data set, either at the outset when taking measurements, or when
collecting, transcribing and entering the data into a computer. It
is hard to eliminate all of these errors. However, you can reduce
the number of typing and transcribing errors by checking the
data carefully once they have been entered. Simply scanning the
data by eye will often identify values that are obviously wrong. In
this chapter we suggest a number of other approaches that you
can use when checking data.

is hard to eliminate all of these errors. However, you can reduce
the number of typing and transcribing errors by checking the
data carefully once they have been entered. Simply scanning the
data by eye will often identify values that are obviously wrong. In
this chapter we suggest a number of other approaches that you
can use when checking data.

Typing errors
Typing mistakes are the most frequent source of errors when
entering data. If the amount of data is small, then you can check
the typed data set against the original forms/questionnaires to
see whether there are any typing mistakes. However, this is timeconsuming
if the amount of data is large. It is possible to type the
data in twice and compare the two data sets using a computer
program. Any differences between the two data sets will reveal
typing mistakes. Although this approach does not rule out the
possibility that the same error has been incorrectly entered on
both occasions, or that the value on the form/questionnaire is
incorrect, it does at least minimize the number of errors. The
disadvantage of this method is that it takes twice as long to enter
the data, which may have major cost or time implications.

Error checking
• Categorical data – it is relatively easy to check categorical
data, as the responses for each variable can only take one of a
number of limited values. Therefore, values that are not allowable
must be errors.
• Numerical data – numerical data are often difficult to check
but are prone to errors. For example, it is simple to transpose digits
or to misplace a decimal point when entering numerical data.
Numerical data can be range checked – that is, upper and lower
limits can be specified for each variable. If a value lies outside this
range then it is flagged up for further investigation.
• Dates – it is often difficult to check the accuracy of dates,
although sometimes you may know that dates must fall within
certain time periods. Dates can be checked to make sure that
they are valid. For example, 30th February must be incorrect,
as must any day of the month greater than 31, and any month
greater than 12. Certain logical checks can also be applied. For
example, a patient’s date of birth should correspond to his/her
age, and patients should usually have been born before entering
the study (at least in most studies). In addition, patients who
have died should not appear for subsequent follow-up visits!
With all error checks, a value should only be corrected if there
is evidence that a mistake has been made. You should not change
values simply because they look unusual.

Handling missing data
There is always a chance that some data will be missing.
If a large proportion of the data is missing, then the results
are unlikely to be reliable. The reasons why data are missing
should always be investigated – if missing data tend to cluster
on a particular variable and/or in a particular subgroup of
individuals, then it may indicate that the variable is not applicable
or has never been measured for that group of individuals.
If this is the case, it may be necessary to exclude that variable
or group of individuals from the analysis. There are different
types of missing data1:
• Missing completely at random (MCAR) – the missing values
are truly randomly distributed in the data set and the fact that
they are missing is unrelated to any study variable. The resulting
parameter estimates are unlikely to be biased (Chapter 34). An
example is when a patient fails to attend a hospital appointment
because he is in a car accident.
• Missing at random (MAR) – the missing values of a variable
do not depend on that variable but can be completely explained
by non-missing values of one or more of the other variables. For
example, suppose that individuals are asked to keep a diet diary if
their BMI is above 30 kg/m2: the missing diet diary data are MAR
because missingness is completely determined by BMI (those with
a BMI below the cut-off do not complete the diet diary).
• Missing not at random (MNAR) – the chance that data on a
particular variable are missing is strongly related to that variable.
In this situation, our results may be severely biased For example,
suppose we are interested in a measurement that reflects the
health status of patients and this information is missing for some
patients because they were not well enough to attend their clinic
appointments: we are likely to get an overly optimistic overall
view of the patients’ health if we take no account of the missing
data in the analysis.

Provided the missing data are not MNAR, we may be able
to estimate (impute) the missing data2. A simple approach is
to replace a missing observation by the mean of the existing
observations for that variable or, if the data are longitudinal, by
the last observed value. These are examples of single imputation.
In multiple imputation, we create a number (generally up to five)
of imputed data sets from the original data set, with the missing
values replaced by imputed values which are derived from an
appropriate model that incorporates random variation. We then

Chapter 3 Error checking and outliers
use standard statistical procedures on each complete imputed 7
data set and finally combine the results from these analyses.
Alternative statistical approaches to dealing with missing data
are available2, but the best option is to minimize the amount of
missing data at the outset.

Outliers
What are outliers?
Outliers are observations that are distinct from the main body
of the data, and are incompatible with the rest of the data. These
values may be genuine observations from individuals with very
extreme levels of the variable. However, they may also result
from typing errors or the incorrect choice of units, and so any
suspicious values should be checked. It is important to detect
whether there are outliers in the data set, as they may have a
considerable impact on the results from some types of analyses
(Chapter 29).
For example, a woman who is 7 feet tall would probably
appear as an outlier in most data sets. However, although this
value is clearly very high, compared with the usual heights
of women, it may be genuine and the woman may simply be
very tall. In this case, you should investigate this value further,
possibly checking other variables such as her age and weight,
before making any decisions about the validity of the result.
The value should only be changed if there really is evidence that
it is incorrect.

Checking for outliers
A simple approach is to print the data and visually check them by
eye. This is suitable if the number of observations is not too large and
if the potential outlier is much lower or higher than the rest of the
data. Range checking should also identify possible outliers. Alternatively,
the data can be plotted in some way (Chapter 4) – outliers can
be clearly identified on histograms and scatter plots (see also Chapter
29 for a discussion of outliers in regression analysis).
Handling outliers
It is important not to remove an individual from an analysis
simply because his/her values are higher or lower than might be
expected. However, the inclusion of outliers may affect the results
when some statistical techniques are used. A simple approach is
to repeat the analysis both including and excluding the value –
this is a type of sensitivity analysis (Chapter 35). If the results
are similar, then the outlier does not have a great influence on
the result. However, if the results change drastically, it is important
to use appropriate methods that are not affected by outliers
to analyse the data. These include the use of transformations
(Chapter 9) and non-parametric tests (Chapter 17).

After entering the data described in Chapter 2, the data set
is checked for errors (Fig. 3.1). Some of the inconsistencies
highlighted are simple data entry errors. For example, the
code of ‘41’ in the ‘Sex of baby’ column is incorrect as a result
of the sex information being missing for patient 20; the rest
of the data for patient 20 had been entered in the incorrect
columns. Others (e.g. unusual values in the gestational age
and weight columns) are likely to be errors, but the notes
should be checked before any decision is made, as these
may reflect genuine outliers. In this case, the gestational age
of patient number 27 was 41 weeks, and it was decided that
a weight of 11.19 kg was incorrect. As it was not possible to
find the correct weight for this baby, the value was entered
as missing.
