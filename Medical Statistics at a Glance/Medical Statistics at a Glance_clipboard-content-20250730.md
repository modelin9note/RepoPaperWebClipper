Medical Statistics at a Glance is directed at undergraduate
medical students, medical researchers, postgraduates in the
biomedical disciplines and at pharmaceutical industry personnel.
All of these individuals will, at some time in their professional
lives, be faced with quantitative results (their own or those
of others) which will need to be critically evaluated and interpreted,
and some, of course, will have to pass that dreaded statistics
exam! A proper understanding of statistical concepts and
methodology is invaluable for these needs. Much as we should
like to fire the reader with an enthusiasm for the subject of statistics,
we are pragmatic. Our aim in this new edition, as it was in
the earlier editions, is to provide the student and the researcher,
as well as the clinician encountering statistical concepts in the
medical literature, with a book which is sound, easy to read,
comprehensive, relevant, and of useful practical application.

We believe Medical Statistics at a Glance will be particularly
helpful as an adjunct to statistics lectures and as a reference
guide. The structure of this fourth edition is the same as that
of the first three editions. In line with other books in the At a
Glance series, we lead the reader through a number of selfcontained
two-, three- or occasionally four-page chapters, each
covering a different aspect of medical statistics. There is extensive
cross-referencing throughout the text to help the reader link the
various procedures. We have learned from our own teaching
experiences and have taken account of the difficulties that our
students have encountered when studying medical statistics. For
this reason, we have chosen to limit the theoretical content of the
book to a level that is sufficient for understanding the procedures
involved, yet which does not overshadow the practicalities of
their execution.

Medical statistics is a wide-ranging subject covering a large
number of topics. We have provided a basic introduction to the
underlying concepts of medical statistics and a guide to the most
commonly used statistical procedures. Epidemiology, concerned
with the distribution and determinants of disease in specified
populations, is closely allied to medical statistics. Hence some
of the main issues in epidemiology, relating to study design and
interpretation, are discussed. Also included are chapters that
the reader may find useful only occasionally, but which are,
nevertheless, fundamental to many areas of medical research;
for example, evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews
and meta-analysis, survival analysis, Bayesian methods and
the development of prognostic scores. We have explained the
principles underlying these topics so that the reader will be able
to understand and interpret the results from them when they are
presented in the literature.

A basic set of statistical tables is contained in Appendix A.
Neave, H.R. (1995) Elementary Statistical Tables, Routledge:
London, and Diem, K. Lenter, C. and Seldrup (1981) Geigy
Scientific Tables, 8th rev. and enl. edition, Basle: Ciba-Geigy,
amongst others, provide fuller versions if the reader requires
more precise results for hand calculations. We have included
a new appendix, Appendix D, in this fourth edition. This
appendix contains guidelines for randomized controlled trials
(the CONSORT checklist and flow chart) and observational
studies (the STROBE checklist). The CONSORT and STROBE
checklists are produced by the EQUATOR Network, initiated
with the objectives of providing resources and training for the
reporting of health research. Guidelines for the presentation of
study results are now available for many other types of study
and we provide website addresses in a table in Appendix D for
some of these designs. Appendix D also contains templates
that we hope you will find useful when you critically appraise
or evaluate the evidence in randomized controlled trials and
observational studies. The use of these templates to critically
appraise two published papers is demonstrated in our Medical
Statistics at a Glance Workbook. Due to the inclusion of the new
Appendix D, the labeling of the final two appendices differs from
that of the third edition: Appendix E now contains the Glossary
of terms with readily accessible explanations of commonly used
terminology, and Appendix F provides cross-referencing of
multiple choice and structured questions from Medical Statistics
at a Glance Workbook.

The chapter titles of this fourth edition are identical to
those of the third edition. Some of the first 46 chapters remain
unaltered in this new edition and some have relatively minor
changes which accommodate recent advances, cross-referencing
or re-organization of the new material. In particular, where
appropriate, we have provided references to the relevant
EQUATOR guidelines.
As in the third edition, we provide a set of learning objectives
for each chapter. Each set provides a framework for evaluating
understanding and progress. If you are able to complete all the
bulleted tasks in a chapter satisfactorily, you will have mastered
the concepts in that chapter.

Most of the statistical techniques described in the book
are accompanied by examples illustrating their use. We have
replaced many of the older examples that were in previous
editions by those that are commensurate with current clinical
research. We have generally obtained the data for our examples
from collaborative studies in which we or colleagues have
been involved; in some instances, we have used real data from
published papers. Where possible, we have used the same data
set in more than one chapter to reflect the reality of data analysis,
which is rarely restricted to a single technique or approach.

Although we believe that formulae should be provided and the
logic of the approach explained as an aid to understanding, we
have avoided showing the details of complex calculations – most
readers will have access to computers and are unlikely to perform
any but the simplest calculations by hand.
We consider that it is particularly important for the reader to
be able to interpret output from a computer package. We have
therefore chosen, where applicable, to show results using extracts
from computer output. In some instances, where we believe
individuals may have difficulty with its interpretation, we have
included (Appendix C) and annotated the complete computer
output from an analysis of a data set. There are many statistical
packages in common use; to give the reader an indication of how
output can vary, we have not restricted the output to a particular
package and have, instead, used four well-known ones – SAS,
SPSS, Stata and R.

We know that one of the greatest difficulties facing nonstatisticians
is choosing the appropriate technique. We have
therefore produced two flow charts which can be used both to
aid the decision as to what method to use in a given situation and
to locate a particular technique in the book easily. These flow
charts are displayed prominently on the inside back cover for
easy access.

Data and statistics
The purpose of most studies is to collect data to obtain information
about a particular area of research. Our data comprise observations
on one or more variables; any quantity that varies is termed
a variable. For example, we may collect basic clinical and demographic
information on patients with a particular illness. The variables
of interest may include the sex, age and height of the patients.
Our data are usually obtained from a sample of individuals
that represents the population of interest. Our aim is to condense
these data in a meaningful way and extract useful information
from them. Statistics encompasses the methods of collecting,
summarizing, analysing and drawing conclusions from the data:
we use statistical techniques to achieve our aim.
Data may take many different forms. We need to know what
form every variable takes before we can make a decision regarding
the most appropriate statistical methods to use. Each variable
and the resulting data will be one of two types: categorical or
numerical (Fig. 1.1).

Nominal Ordinal Discrete Continuous
Categories
are mutually
exclusive and
unordered
e.g.
Sex (male/
female)
Blood group
(A/B/AB/O)
Categories
are mutually
exclusive and
ordered
e.g.
Disease stage
(mild/moderate/
severe)
Integer values,
typically
counts
e.g.
Days sick
last year
Takes any value
in a range of
values
e.g.
Weight in kg
Height in cm

Categorical (qualitative) data
These occur when each individual can only belong to one of a
number of distinct categories of the variable.
• Nominal data – the categories are not ordered but simply have
names. Examples include blood group (A, B, AB and O) and
marital status (married/widowed/single, etc.). In this case, there
is no reason to suspect that being married is any better (or worse)
than being single!
• Ordinal data – the categories are ordered in some way. Examples
include disease staging systems (advanced, moderate, mild,
none) and degree of pain (severe, moderate, mild, none).
A categorical variable is binary or dichotomous when there
are only two possible categories. Examples include ‘Yes/No’, ‘Dead/
Alive’ or ‘Patient has disease/Patient does not have disease’.

Numerical (quantitative) data
These occur when the variable takes some numerical value. We
can subdivide numerical data into two types.
• Discrete data – occur when the variable can only take certain
whole numerical values. These are often counts of numbers of
events, such as the number of visits to a GP in a particular year or the
number of episodes of illness in an individual over the last 5 years.
• Continuous data – occur when there is no limitation on the
values that the variable can take, e.g. weight or height, other than
that which restricts us when we make the measurement.

Distinguishing between data types
We often use very different statistical methods depending on
whether the data are categorical or numerical. Although the
distinction between categorical and numerical data is usually
clear, in some situations it may become blurred. For example,
when we have a variable with a large number of ordered categories
(e.g. a pain scale with seven categories), it may be difficult
to distinguish it from a discrete numerical variable. The
distinction between discrete and continuous numerical data
may be even less clear, although in general this will have little
impact on the results of most analyses. Age is an example of a
variable that is often treated as discrete even though it is truly
continuous. We usually refer to ‘age at last birthday’ rather than
‘age’, and therefore, a woman who reports being 30 may have
just had her 30th birthday, or may be just about to have her
31st birthday.
Do not be tempted to record numerical data as categorical at
the outset (e.g. by recording only the range within which each
patient’s age falls rather than his/her actual age) as important
information is often lost. It is simple to convert numerical data to
categorical data once they have been collected.

Derived data
We may encounter a number of other types of data in the medical
field. These include:
• Percentages – these may arise when considering improvements
in patients following treatment, e.g. a patient’s lung

function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1) may 3
increase by 24% following treatment with a new drug. In this
case, it is the level of improvement, rather than the absolute
value, which is of interest.
• Ratios or quotients – occasionally you may encounter the
ratio or quotient of two variables. For example, body mass index
(BMI), calculated as an individual’s weight (kg) divided by her/
his height squared (m2), is often used to assess whether s/he is
over- or underweight.
• Rates – disease rates, in which the number of disease events
occurring among individuals in a study is divided by the total
number of years of follow-up of all individuals in that study
(Chapter 31), are common in epidemiological studies (Chapter 12).
• Scores – we sometimes use an arbitrary value, such as a score,
when we cannot measure a quantity. For example, a series of
responses to questions on quality of life may be summed to give
some overall quality of life score on each individual.
All these variables can be treated as numerical variables for most
analyses. Where the variable is derived using more than one value
(e.g. the numerator and denominator of a percentage), it is important
to record all of the values used. For example, a 10% improvement in
a marker following treatment may have different clinical relevance
depending on the level of the marker before treatment.

Censored data
We may come across censored data in situations illustrated by
the following examples.
• If we measure laboratory values using a tool that can only detect
levels above a certain cut-off value, then any values below this cutoff
will not be detected, i.e. they are censored. For example, when
measuring virus levels, those below the limit of detectability will
often be reported as ‘undetectable’ or ‘unquantifiable’ even though
there may be some virus in the sample. In this situation, if the lower
cut-off of a tool is x, say, the results may be reported as ‘ < x’. Similarly,
some tools may only be able to reliably quantify levels below a
certain cut-off value, say y; any measurements above that value will
also be censored and the test result may be reported as ‘ > y’.
• We may encounter censored data when following patients in
a trial in which, for example, some patients withdraw from the
trial before the trial has ended. This type of data is discussed in
more detail in Chapter 44.
