Quantification of amyloid PET for future clinical use: a state-of-the-art review

Abstract
Amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology is one of the earliest detectable brain changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. The overall load and spatial distribution of brain Aβ can be determined in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET), for which three fluorine-18 labelled radiotracers have been approved for clinical use. In clinical practice, trained readers will categorise scans as either Aβ positive or negative, based on visual inspection. Diagnostic decisions are often based on these reads and patient selection for clinical trials is increasingly guided by amyloid status. However, tracer deposition in the grey matter as a function of amyloid load is an inherently continuous process, which is not sufficiently appreciated through binary cut-offs alone. State-of-the-art methods for amyloid PET quantification can generate tracer-independent measures of Aβ burden. Recent research has shown the ability of these quantitative measures to highlight pathological changes at the earliest stages of the AD continuum and generate more sensitive thresholds, as well as improving diagnostic confidence around established binary cut-offs. With the recent FDA approval of aducanumab and more candidate drugs on the horizon, early identification of amyloid burden using quantitative measures is critical for enrolling appropriate subjects to help establish the optimal window for therapeutic intervention and secondary prevention. In addition, quantitative amyloid measurements are used for treatment response monitoring in clinical trials. In clinical settings, large multi-centre studies have shown that amyloid PET results change both diagnosis and patient management and that quantification can accurately predict rates of cognitive decline. Whether these changes in management reflect an improvement in clinical outcomes is yet to be determined and further validation work is required to establish the utility of quantification for supporting treatment endpoint decisions. In this state-of-the-art review, several tools and measures available for amyloid PET quantification are summarised and discussed. Use of these methods is growing both clinically and in the research domain. Concurrently, there is a duty of care to the wider dementia community to increase visibility and understanding of these methods.

Introduction
Amyloid-β and the AD continuum
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60–80% of cases above 65 years of age [1]. One of the earliest detectable brain changes in AD pathogenesis is amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque accumulation [2–4]. However, historically, AD has been diagnosed solely based on symptomatology, with a definite diagnosis only possible by post-mortem examination. With the recent arrival and increased availability of biomarkers for AD pathology, there has been a shift towards biomarker-based diagnosis, which can be appreciated in the 2007 research diagnosis criteria from the International Working Group [5, 6]. Updated in 2021 [7], the guidelines now further highlight amyloid’s central role in the AD diagnostic process. In research settings, a biomarker-only classification scheme has even been proposed, the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) framework [8], which further highlights the shift towards a biological definition of the disease independent of clinically defined diagnostic schemes. Detection of abnormal Aβ only, referred to as “Alzheimer’s pathologic change” (A+/T−), is considered the essential first step and if followed by a pathological change in tau progresses to the classification of AD (A+/T+) — with or without dementia. Amyloid biomarkers have been used as part of the A/T/N framework in large validation studies of population-based cohorts [9, 10], memory clinic populations [11, 12], cognitively unimpaired subjects [13], and longitudinal cognitive outcomes [9, 11, 13]. The central role of amyloid pathology across the AD continuum has been of major interest for both AD clinical research and drug development [14–17]. Alongside the development of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood-based biomarkers, molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) plays an increasingly important role in determining biomarker status [18].

Amyloid PET
The use of amyloid PET allows for the in vivo visualisation and quantification of Aβ protein fibrillary deposits, directly providing information on the total load and spatial distribution of Aβ pathology. Three fluorine-18 amyloid PET tracers are currently available for routine clinical use (Fig. 1) and have been validated against Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) pathology as the gold standard. These radiotracers are [18F]florbetapir (Amyvid™; Avid Radiopharmaceuticals; approved in 2012) [19], [18F]flutemetamol (Vizamyl™; GE Healthcare; approved in 2013) [20], and [18F]florbetaben (Neuraceq™; Life Molecular Imaging; approved in 2014) [21]. Each of these radiotracers has different pharmacokinetics, chemical structure, and binding site/properties. However, they have all been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Authority (EMA) for routine clinical use, and have local regulatory approval in other countries, such as Japan and Korea. The tracers are also widely used by the research community. In addition, other known compounds such as the carbon-11 labelled Pittsburgh compound B ([11C]PiB) [22] and [18F]NAV4694 [18, 23] are available for investigational use only.

Clinical utility of amyloid PET
Routine clinical use of amyloid PET tracers involves visual assessment and binary categorisation of scans, based on tracer-specific manufacturers’ guidelines [24–26]. Classification is either negative (predominantly white matter uptake) or positive (binding in one or more cortical brain regions, or the striatum for [18F]flutemetamol and [11C]PiB). Certified readers are required by the regulatory authorities to complete and pass a training program specific to each radiotracer [27–29]. The visual assessment scales and guidelines are different for each radiotracer. However, high inter-rater agreement for visual rating protocols has been demonstrated for all 18F-labelled amyloid tracers [30], suggesting that visual interpretation of amyloid imaging by experts is not dependent on the rating protocol. Furthermore, efforts to create a universal visual assessment protocol for all amyloid imaging tracers are underway [31].

Over the past decade, many studies have demonstrated the level of analytical and clinical validity of amyloid PET in routine clinical practice [25, 29, 32–40]. More specifically, real-world studies have shown that disclosure of amyloid PET imaging results leads to a change in etiological diagnosis in approximately 25–31% of cases [33, 35, 36], significant increases in diagnostic confidence [33, 36, 38–40], and changes in patient management in approximately 37–72% of cases [35–38]. Appropriate use criteria have also been published for amyloid PET [41]. However, recent evidence suggests that patients beyond the appropriate use criteria can also benefit from amyloid PET through changes in management and diagnosis [42]. For example, research has suggested that anti-amyloid strategies could be a relevant approach to slow disease progression in Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia [43, 44]. Also, in subjective cognitive decline (SCD) patients, for whom a positive or negative amyloid status can increase diagnostic confidence [33, 34, 37]. The largest clinical utility study to date is the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) study, which was designed to investigate the clinical utility of amyloid PET. The study enrolled over 18,000 patients from 946 dementia specialists at 595 centres in America [34]. Of the 11,409 patients completing study procedures, the composite endpoint changed in 4159 of 6905 patients with MCI (60.2%), the etiological diagnosis changed from AD to non-AD in 2860 (25.1%), and from non-AD to AD in 1201 (10.5%) cases, which was linked with changes in clinical management within 90 days. Whether these changes in management reflect an improvement in clinical outcomes for dementia patients is yet to be determined.

Global multi-centre studies adopting amyloid PET
Global multi-centre studies and consortia aiming to unravel the influence, prognostic value, and role of amyloid deposition in the AD timeline have been ongoing for some time. The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study began in 2005 [45] and has acquired amyloid PET in thousands of mainly MCI patients [46–48] (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). The first results from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were published in 2009 [49] and has continued to monitor over 1,000 volunteers (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/category/aibl-study-data/). More recently, in 2016, the AMYPAD consortium was initiated involving multiple academic and private research partners (https://amypad.eu/). AMYPAD consists of two substudies: (i) the diagnostic and patient management study (DPMS) [50], assessing amyloid PET’s impact on clinical management and diagnosis where quantitative measures will be the secondary endpoint; and (ii) the prognostic and natural history study (PNHS) [51]. In the PNHS, quantitative measures are the primary endpoint and amyloid PET is used to understand the development of AD in the pre-dementia phase of the disease, including cognitively unimpaired, SCD, and MCI participants. Given these goals, another major objective of AMYPAD is the development and validation of robust standardised methodology for quantitatively measuring brain amyloid [52], see “Future directions” section later in this review for an overview of AMYPAD’s ongoing studies. Studies such as these highlight the importance of amyloid PET and quantitative measures across the AD continuum, while visual reading remains the most common method of Aβ pathology in clinical routine.

Challenges of amyloid PET visual assessment across the clinical spectrum
Phase III autopsy validation studies have shown that binary classification through visual assessment is approximately 90% accurate in advanced clinical and end-of-life subjects, providing a useful stratification of Aβ status for clinical routine, clinical trials, and research purposes [20, 21, 27]. In a heterogeneous clinical population, visual assessment can be challenged by partial volume effects compounded by cortical thinning or atrophy, which in turn raises the question of whether or not to perform partial volume correction (PVC). The field remains divided on this issue, where recent evidence suggests that PVC can increase sensitivity for detecting early stage cerebral amyloidosis [53], but other studies comparing techniques have proven inconclusive [54, 55]. In addition, comorbidities such as normal pressure hydrocephalus [56] or other neurodegenerative disorders can further complicate visual assessments [29, 57–60]. However, the proportion of pre-dementia patients assessed in memory clinics has significantly increased over the past few years, with up to ~25% of patients presenting with SCD [61]. In these subjects, amyloid deposition may be emerging or focal [62], which makes visual assessment more challenging, especially by less experienced readers [63]. In such cases, the dichotomous approach is more prone to subjectivity, as it heavily relies on the prior experience of the clinician, resulting in higher inter-rater variability [19, 30, 64–66]. Therefore, adjunct quantitative measures of amyloid deposition and more sensitive thresholds are beneficial [25, 67–69]. In addition, quantification could hold a range of benefits and clinical utility on top of current binary classification, such as improvements in diagnostic confidence, prediction of cognitive decline, and changes to patient management [58, 70–74]. Similar utility has been shown for other neurological disorders, for example, quantification of regional atrophy patterns in dementia [75–78] and traumatic brain injury [79, 80]; hippocampal sclerosis and quantitative T2 signal in temporal lobe epilepsy [81–84]; stroke severity quantification by critical care physicians [85, 86]; pre-surgical planning and survival prediction in glioma resection [87, 88]; and lesion load measurements in multiple sclerosis [89–91]. The various quantitative measures available for amyloid PET quantification are discussed in detail later in the review.

Aims of this state-of-the-art review
In this review, methods for quantification of static amyloid PET scans are summarised and compared along with a discussion of the overall utility of amyloid PET quantification in routine clinical practice, observational research, and clinical trials. The general aim is to facilitate greater understanding and wider use of sensitive standardised methodologies for measuring Aβ pathology. More specifically, accurate cross-sectional and longitudinal measurement of brain amyloid pathology can support the use of amyloid PET biomarkers in clinical and research settings, by providing information on the extent of pathology. This could include the evaluation of both early and established amyloid pathology, improving our understanding of disease development, and consequently optimise individualised risk stratification. Full quantification using dynamic PET acquisition and determination of the non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) were beyond the scope of this review; as such, the methods covered in this review constitute semi-quantification of amyloid PET. Indeed, factors such as acquisition time window and regional cerebral blood flow can impact methods based on static acquisitions, although the latter does not play a major role in an early AD population [92, 93]. For a review on the value of full PET quantitation, see Lammertsma [94].

Quantitative measures for clinical assessment of amyloid burden
Quantification of static amyloid PET scans can be performed using software packages to calculate both regional and composite levels of amyloid burden. Importantly, these packages generate a continuous measure of amyloid burden which can be used in addition to dichotomous visual reads. Currently available measures are the more commonly used standardised uptake value ratio (SUVr) [95], the Centiloid (CL) scale [74, 96], and reference-based z-scores [97], while the more recent methods include the Aβ load [98], Aβ index [99], and AMYQ [100]. Both CL and z-scores are calculated based on SUVr, whereas the emerging methods use different approaches to select the target and reference regions for segmenting regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, each method provides a unique unit/scale and specific metric for quantification, which motivated inclusion in this review. A key area of current research focusses on the potential sensitivity of visual assessment and quantification methods to variation in scanners [101], reconstruction algorithms [102–104], scanning time, and scanning window [93, 105, 106], all of which can affect both visual assessment and quantification. See “Future directions” later in this review for an overview of ongoing technical validation studies. While these quantification measures are becoming increasingly common for research purposes, some of these metrics have also been used in clinical practice and trial settings. Quantification could supplement visual inspection of amyloid PET imaging, especially for (i) less experienced readers [63]; (ii) equivocal (“grey zone”) cases [107, 108] where diagnostic confidence is low [109]; and (iii) for assessing isolated regional uptake [57, 110]. In clinical trials, quantification can be used to better guide patient enrolment and for therapy response monitoring [111–114].

Standardised uptake value ratio
The most widely used measure for quantifying amyloid burden is the SUVr. It is a simplified method based on computing the ratio of tracer uptake between a target region and a reference region in a late (static) PET acquisition, when the radiotracer is expected to have reached pseudo-equilibrium [95] (Fig. 2). Target regions can include either individual regions or be a composite of several (cortical) regions. Common ROIs in the amyloid PET radiotracer product labels include the medial orbital frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, lateral temporal lobes, precuneus, posterior cingulate, parietal lobe, and striatum. On the other hand, reference regions should ideally have no specific tracer binding, similar tissue characteristics/kinetics as the target regions, and tracer uptake in reference region should be unaffected by the disease under investigation, making the cerebellar cortex a suitable reference regions for amyloid tracers in most cases [94, 115]. Alternative reference regions have been proposed, such as the pons, whole cerebellum, and subcortical white matter, as their use generally results in increased stability of quantification over time [116–118].

Various software packages are clinically available (see “Regulatory approved tools and research methods for amyloid PET quantification” section below) to quantify brain amyloid using SUVr. Using these software approaches, optimal SUVr cut-offs for amyloid positivity have been defined using various approaches and for different purposes: receiver operating characteristics for differential diagnosis [119], comparison with histological findings [19, 20], and using young healthy adults as a definition for amyloid negativity [120].

SUVr is the most widely used and established metric [121], having been implemented in several recent trials to assess treatment efficacy [122–128]. However, accurate measurement and cut-off values are highly dependent on the chosen tracer, reference region (Fig. 2), and delineation method [74, 129, 130], which challenges the pooling of multi-centre SUVr data across tracers [131]. In addition, there is high variability in longitudinal results [93, 132], which limits the power in detecting genuine biological differences. SUVr values can also vary based on partial volume averaging effects [133, 134]. However, PVC intrinsically amplifies noise in trying to reduce bias and, therefore, a given PVC method needs to be finely tuned to the particular image characteristics so that the beneficial effects of the method outweigh anything detrimental.
